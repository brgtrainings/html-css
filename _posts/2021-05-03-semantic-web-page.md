The term _Semantic element_ means _an element with a meaning_.

A _semantic element_ clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Example: `<form>`, `<table>`, `<article>`, `<main>` tags clearly defines what its content will be.

However, the non-semantic elements like `<div>`, `<span>` tell nothing about its content.
